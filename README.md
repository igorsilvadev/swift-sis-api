# SIS-API (Search In Swift) is an API developed entirely in Swift that uses the Web Scrapping technique to search images and return a JSON with the URLs of the results. 
It uses: 

- [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup) (Pure Swift HTML Parser, with best of DOM, CSS, and jquery (Supports Linux, iOS, Mac, tvOS, watchOS) to bring these results. 
- Steam 4](https://github.com/vapor/) ( Backend)

The results are extracted from a Bing Image Search request.
This is an initial version and later there will be improvements in architecture, performance and new filters. 

To use this image API, just make a request to https://sis-api.herokuapp.com/sis/api/v1/search/image/.
After /image/{name of the image you want to search for}
